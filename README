This is a simple IRC bot for the #turmeric-dev channel.  It's main goal
is to watch the builds, forums, and jira tracking system and inform
the developers when new messages and events happen.

It also does dumb things like check the weather and report the time.

I haven't figured out how to have to make coffee yet.
